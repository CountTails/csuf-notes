# School Notes

## Description

This is a monorepo for all notes that have been taken during my time as an graduate student at [CS Fullerton](https://www.fullerton.edu). While this does **not** cover all the notes for *every* class that I took, it focuses on courses that are major requirements or closely related to [Master of Science in Software Engineering](https://www.fullerton.edu/ecs/mse/) program.

This repository is a work-in-progress. Notes are added as classes take place.
