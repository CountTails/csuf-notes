# Lecture 10: the explore phase

## Agile Leaders vs. Project Administrators

- **Project Administrators**: Handle compliance and administrative overhead.
- **Agile Leaders**: Focus on technical excellence, inspiration, and customer value.

### Agile Project Leadership

- Manage up: functional managers and executives understand agile
- Manage out: customers understand their key role in agile projects
- Manage team: team embraces and fully understands agile principles and practices

### New Dimensions of Agile Project Leader’s Role

1. Clearly articulate goals and constraints.
2. Facilitate team interactions and decisions.
3. Encourage risk-taking.
4. Ensure continuous feedback.
5. Address reality proactively when issues arise.

## Iteration Planning and Monitoring

### Iteration Planning Activities:

- Planning, workload management, monitoring progress.
- Emphasis on team accountability and collective commitment.

### Planning Process

- Define iteration themes.
- Breakdown of stories into tasks.
- **Estimating**: Match capacity with planned stories/tasks (story points velocity, 2–10 day stories, tasks <8 hours).
- **Iteration length**: Not always shorter; balance between user-value and technical realities.

> As long as teams are delivering on their commitments, they should decide the level of task detail

### Optimization Strategies:

- Balance technical debt management, legacy code, QA/testing needs.
- Keep iteration lengths consistent yet flexible for effective development.

## Workload Management

- Team-driven task assignments (self-sign up encouraged).
- Leaders intervene as coaches, not controllers.

### Agile Leadership and Coaching

- Agile leaders monitor without micromanaging.
- Focus on steering teams, establishing clear performance goals, and fostering a supportive environment.

### Monitoring Iteration Progress

- Iteration managers actively participate, encouraging self-organization.
- Use progression, story check-off, and burn-down charts prudently; avoid hindering self-organization.

## Technical Debt

### Understanding Technical Debt:

- Represents the gap between actual and optimal cost-of-change.
- Frequent reduction is critical.

### Managing Strategies:

- Early and continuous attention is necessary.
- Technical excellence directly reduces debt accumulation.

## Simple Design: Anticipation vs. Adaptation

- Simple design favors adaptability over anticipation.
- Anticipation sometimes needed for platforms/product lines.

### Practices for Simple Design:

- Balance anticipation/adaptation depending on system malleability.
- Simplicity ≠ simplistic; prioritize customer value.
- Utilize simulation/modeling for adaptability.

## Continuous Integration

### Objectives and Benefits:

- Reduce high cost of late misalignment and burden of testing
- Mitigate common problems in hardware and software development
- Facilitates frequent integration to address challenges
- Enhances communication and resource management.

### Agile Approach in Integration:

- Overlap concept development and implementation
- Extends "software freeze" to later in development
- Allows late-discovered hardware flaws to be addressed in software
- Focuses on technology integration capability and constant testing

## Ruthless Automated Testing

- Supports running tested features every iteration
- Quality must be built into the development process
- Early fault detection reduces the cost of change
- Constant testing provides a necessary feedback loop
- In software software development: unit testing, QA testing, and automated tests

## Opportunistic Refactoring

- Deliver features today and in the future
- High technical debt hinders software's competitive advantage
- Evolutionary design process promotes adaptability
- Refactoring requires automated testing and persistence
- Refactoring decisions are product management and executive decisions

## Refactoring in Agile

- Shift from "get it right first time" to keeping change costs low through continuous refactoring.
- Requires ongoing executive and product manager support.
- Need to be persistent with constant investment in refactoring, redesign and testing
- Adequate return on investment is key

## Coaching and Team Development

Agile leaders enhance team performance by:

1) Clarifying vision and objectives (focus on outcomes, not methods).
2) Building cohesive ("jelled") teams through trust and participatory decision-making.
3) Developing individual capabilities and fostering self-organizing behaviors.
4) Providing resources and removing impediments (address productivity loss proactively).
5) Coaching customers for effective collaboration.
6) Orchestrating rhythmic workflow through iterations and reflective pauses.

## Decision Making in Agile

### Decision Framing:

- Involvement of appropriate stakeholders is essential.
- Agile values support collaborative decision-making.

### Effective Decision Processes:

- Avoid "winners vs losers" dynamics.
- Evaluate decisions on quality and implementation effectiveness.

### Decision Gradients:

- Visual tool to gauge consensus and highlight disagreement.
- Consensus defined by broad understanding, not necessarily unanimity.

### Benefits of Participatory Decision-Making:

- Enhanced mutual understanding reduces future decision-making time.
- Reduces constant arguing on the same points over and over again

### Decision Retrospection:

- Critical to learning and avoiding repeated mistakes.
- Often overlooked, but essential for improving team decisions.

### Agile Leadership Decisions:

- Good leaders balance decision-making authority with team autonomy.
- Leaders intervene strategically, respecting team self-organization.

### Set and Delay-Based Decision-Making:

- Toyota’s approach: Delay final decisions to explore multiple solutions ("Set-based concurrent engineering").
- Enhances system robustness through maintained flexibility.

## Collaboration and Coordination

- Essential daily interaction through:
  - Regular stand-up meetings.
  - Close product team involvement.
  - Active stakeholder management.

### Stand-Up Meeting Guidelines:

- Brief daily meetings (<15 mins) at a consistent time/place.
- Facilitated discussion on immediate tasks and impediments, not solutions.

### Product Team Interaction:

- Continuous product management involvement to address uncertainty and risk.
- Technical "frontiers" need to be fully involved with team decisions

### Stakeholder Coordination:

- Project leader’s responsibility to handle stakeholder communication effectively.
- Protect team from disruptive external politics.

## Transition to Adapt and Close Phase

- Review product value, quality, project status, and team performance to prepare adaptive actions.
