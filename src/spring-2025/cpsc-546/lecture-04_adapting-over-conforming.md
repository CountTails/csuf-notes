# Lecture 4: adapting over conforming

## Change and adaptation

- Change: to cause to be different, to give a completely different form or appearance to
- Adapt: to make suitable to or fit for a specific use or situation; a mindful response to change

### 5 principle statements about adaptation

- We expect uncertainty and manage for it through iterations, anticipation, and adaptation (DOI)
- We improve effectiveness and reliability through situationally specific strategies, processes, and practices (DOI)
- Responding to change over following a plan (AM)
- Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage (AM)
- At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly (AM)

> AM = agile manifesto; DOI = declaration of independence

### Adapting versus anticipating

> Teams must adapt, but they can't lose track of the project's ultimate goals. Teams should constantly evaluate progress, whether adapting and anticipating, by asking these four questions

1) Is value, in the form of a releasable product, being delivered?
2) Is the quality goal of building a reliable, adaptable product being met?
3) Is the project progressing satisfactorily within acceptable constraints?
4) Is the team adapting effectively to changes imposed by management, customers, or technology?

### Be aware

- When uncertainty is low, adaptive approaches run the risks of higher costs

## Agile software development

- Agile development is characterized by the ability to respond to change quickly and effectively
- The agile manifesto values "responding to change" over "following a plan"
- Envision/explore approach is preferred over Plan/do approach

### Responding to change

- We expect change (uncertainty) and respond accordingly rather than follow outdated plans
- Change is inevitable and it's important to be able to respond accordingly
- The failure to adapt can lead to project disasters and costly mistakes
- Balancing planning and adapting is essential for project management

### Production versus exploration style projects

- Project can range from production-style (low uncertainty) to exploration-style (high uncertainty)
- Exploration-style projects require an envision/explore approach rather than detailed planning and strict execution of tasks
- Each style is applicable to a particular project type

| Adaptive development process | Optimizing process |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Adaptive reflect an organic, evolutionary envision/explore/adapt life cycle | Optimizing reflects a basic prescriptive plan/design/build life cycle |
| An adaptive approach begins not with a single solution, but with multiple potential solutions. It explores and selects the best by applying a series of fitness tests (actual product features or simulations subjected to acceptance tests) and then adapting to feedback. When uncertainty is low, adaptive approaches run the risk of higher costs. | When uncertainty is high, optimizing approaches run the risk of settling too early on a particular solution and stifling innovation |

### Cost of an iteration

- Cost of an iteration is a significant factor in project management style
- High iteration costs may require a process with greater anticipatory work
- Low cost iterations enable an adaptive style of development in which plans, architectures, and designs evolve concurrently with the actual product

## The agile approach

- Agile software development embraces uncertainty and focuses on adapting rather than anticipating
- Agile methodologies (Scrum, Kanban, Lean) prioritize flexibility and adaptation over rigid adherence to a plan
- Agile development teams foster a culture of collaboration, communication, and experimentation to facilitate adaptation

### Adaptability components

- Product: high quality code with automated tests is a necessity
- Process: required processes and practices that allow the team to adapt to circumstances
- People: must have a good agile team with the right attitude about change

### Challenges of pristine code and non-agile teams

- Pristine (clean) code alone is insufficient for adaptability
- True agility requires a combination of agile team mindset, adaptable processes, and high-quality, well-tested code
- Many software organizations face a barrier to agility due to the failure to address technical debt in legacy code
- Addressing technical debt is challenging, costly, and time-consuming

### Barriers or opportunities

- Excuses or complaints about agile it that
  - They would take too much time
  - They would cost too much
- Opponents refer to agile hype as "new toy" syndrome
  - Change is not easy or comfortable, experienced agilist facing these barriers ask: what would be the benefit if we could do this by agile?
  - Agile development demands short-cycle iterations
  - Short-cycle iterations demand finding ways to do things quickly and inexpensively
  - Doing things quickly and inexpensively
    - Enables teams to respond to changes in ways they never anticipated
    - Saves time and encourages teams to experiment
- Innovations ripple out to other parts of the organization

### Reliable not repeatable

- Contrarily to popular belief, the "repeatable" is **not** in the agile lexicon
- Many ever-changing company's goal is to implement repeatable processes in product (software) development
  - This turns out to be an extremely counterproductive goal
  - Repeatable just means doing the same thing in the same way to produce the same result
- Software development is
  - Input (requirements) -> Process (internal relationship) -> Output (final product)
  - So if input changes, mostly often output should also change
- Repeatable processes reduce variability through measurement and constant process correction. Mostly useful in manufacturing industries when sudden changes are not that common
- Also reduce variability is indirectly called quality (in manufacturing industries) which is totally different form quality in the software development industry
- In a repeatable process
  - Input: are considered as constant
  - Process: fixed process to reduce variability, means fixing all aspects of the process
  - Output: is highly predictable
- Reliable means meeting targets regardless of the problems thrown in your way; it means constantly adapting to meet a goal
- In a reliable process:
  - Input: may change (requirement as per client or stakeholder)
  - Process: need to be changed (we have to change our process to get to intended output)
  - Output: will be main focus

> Repeatability is input driven while reliability is results driven

### Reflection and retrospection

- The 4 stages include product, process, team, and product
- We need feedback in each of these 4 areas at the end of each iteration to further improve upcoming iterations
- We need feedback in each of these 4 areas at the end of each project to further improve upcoming projects

### Principles to practices

- We can talk about what we should do for a whole day, but great products are not created by "what we should do"
- Great products are created by
  - What people do (what processes they follow; how they are thinking)
  - How they behave (what they do in tough situation like frequently changing requirements)
- Although agile guidelines are there, specific practices are necessary to actually accomplish work
  - For that, we need anticipatory and adaptive processes and practices
  - Release planning uses known information to "anticipate" the future
  - Refactoring uses information found later in the project to "adapt" code
