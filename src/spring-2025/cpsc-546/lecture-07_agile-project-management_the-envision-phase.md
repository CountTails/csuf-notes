# Lecture 7: agile project management (the envision phase)

## Establishing a vision

### A good vision is concise

- Some people would argue that the purchase motivations for the product are far too complex to capture in one or two sentences
- Our experience after years of doing market research suggests the opposite
- Most successful products have a clear and simple value proposition
- Buyers typically make their choice between competing products on the basis of 3 or 4 key factors

### Techniques for establishing a shared vision

#### Elevator statement

- A short statement of the product's positioning
- Explains the product to someone in 2 minutes

```plaintext
For [customer]
Who [statement of need or oppurtunity]
The [product name] is a [product category]
That [key benefit, compelling reason to buy]
Unlike [primary competitor],
Our product [statement of primary differentiation]
```

#### Vision box

- Design a box for the software (even if it won't ship in one)
- Write 3-4 key bullet points to sell the software
  - Easy to come up with 15
  - Challenging to cut the list to 3 or 4 key points

#### Press release

- Collaboratively write the press release you'd like to see released at the end
- What are the key points you'd make about the product
- What quotes would you have and who would they be from
  - CEO
  - Team members
  - Customers

#### Magazine review

- Write the review you'd like to see in a magazine relevant to your product (or invent one)
- What key features would be singled out?
- What will be said about your product compared to
  - Its prior versions
  - Competitors

### A releasable product

- A releasable product should fulfill
  - A product vision box
  - Project objective statement
  - Business objectives
  - Capabilities
- A reliable, adaptable product should fulfill quality objectives

## Envisioning practices

This phase has a lot of questions regarding the product, especially around feasibility

- Small projects: kickoff chartering session
- Medium projects: debate and discussion period
- Large projects: iteration 0

### Practice categories

#### Product vision

- Product vision box
  - Show the big picture and explain the high concept
  - A 25 page vision document is a bad idea
- Elevator test statement
  - Identify your target customer
  - Explain key benefits and reasons to buy
  - Describe the primary differentiation from competitors
- Product architecture
  - Experience does matter
  - Project interface and cross component coordination
  - Leaders need technical domain experience
  - Smart use of human resources
  - Influence of core team and feature specific team in architecture and interface design
  - Maximize the employment of reusable components and services to speed up development

#### Project objectives and constraints

- Project data sheet
  - A simple document in a condensed format
  - Reminds project community of strategic aspects of the project
- Trade-off matrix
  - Cost, Time, and Scope vs. Must Meet, Adjust, and Accept
  - Assumes quality variable is fixed, can only assign a 1-to-1 relation
  - Since we **must meet** `[constraint]`, we will **adjust** `[constraint]` as necessary, and **accept resulting** `[constraint]`
- Exploration factor
  - Manages customer and executive exceptions

#### Project community

- Participant identification
  - Who delivers what?
  - Customers (end-users, sponsors, and managers)
  - Project team (developers and stakeholders)
    - Management: design decisions, resource management, budget planning
    - Project manager: leads the team responsible for delivering the product
    - Lead engineer: guides the technical aspects
    - Developers, testers and technical support build
  - External participants
    - Vendors
    - Suppliers
- Product team
  - Major project failures due to poor or lack of communication
  - Product manager defines what to build
  - Project manager figures out how to build
  - Project manager and product manager are the product owners in scrum

- Self-organizing strategy
  - Collaboration between the project community
  - Mechanism to collaborate
  - Requires communication, coordination, collaboration, decision making, and meetings

#### Approach

- Process tailoring framework
  - Process the team uses to deliver a product
  - Starting point is a standard process framework
  - Customization done by project manager and the team tailor to fit their needs and the customers needs
  - Minimizing the organization standard process to help the project
  - The greater number of required artifacts, required decision gates and documentation makes the team less agile
- Practice selection and tailoring
  - Can be done in different ways
  - According to capabilities of team members
  - Size of the project
  - Number of customer and other factors
