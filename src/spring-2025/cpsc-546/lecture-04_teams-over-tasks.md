# Lecture 4: teams over tasks

## Leading teams

- Without adequate management, complex projects rapidly descend into chaos
  - Plans, controls, budgets, and processes help project managers stave off potential project threatening complexity
  - When uncertainty, risk, and change are prominent, these practices are insufficient and adaption practices are required
- Leaders want to create adaptive and self organizing teams
  - They steer these teams rather than control them
  - Involves influencing, nudging, facilitating, teaching, recommending, assisting, urging, counseling, and directing is some instances
- Good leadership contributes significantly to project success
- Leaders, as opposed to managers, encourage change by creating a vision of future possibilities
- Self-directing teams, those that theoretically don't have a single leader, tend to drift and procrastinate, which is not appropriate for fast-moving product development teams

## Building self-disciplined teams

> What hurts productivity? Lack of trust

### Management Illusions

- Common illusions manager have
  - Why do you believe you are in control?
  - Why do you behave as if you can predict the future, its consequences, and outcomes?
  - Why do you think that because you've done it before and it worked that it will work again?
  - Why do you believe everything important is measurable?
  - Why do you think that words like leadership, management, and change have the same meaning for everyone?
  - Why do you think that reducing uncertainty will necessarily increase certainty
- Highly uncertain projects are full anxiety, change, and ambiguity that the team must deal with
  - Takes a different style of project management
  - Uses different patterns of team operation
  - Requires a different type of project leader
- Agile is a sociotechical movement driven by both
  - The desire to create a particular work environment
  - The belief that an adaptive environment is critical to the goal of delivering innovative products to customers

### Encourage collaboration

- The capability of self-organizing teams lies in collaboration (the interaction and cooperation of two or more people to jointly product a result)
- Examples of collaboration include
  - Two engineers scratching out a design on a whiteboard
  - Team members meeting to brainstorm a design
  - Team leaders meeting to decide whether a product is ready to ship
- The result of any collaboration can be categorized as
  - A tangible deliverable
  - A decision
  - Shared knowledge

### Participatory decision making

- Making decisions is the heart and soul of collaboration
- There are literally thousands of decisions (large and small) to be made over the life of a project
  - Designing with another individual
  - Struggling with feature prioritization
  - Deciding to ship or not
- Situations that are not conducive to truly collaborative teams are
  - Teams driven to quick decisions by a senior technical individual
  - Teams driven by those with the loudest voice

### Customer collaboration

- APM depends on effective customer collaboration
  - Customer or product team should be an integral part of any agile development effort
  - Although customer and developer roles are quite different, the more they consider themselves to be a single team, the more effective they will be
- Tasks that help with customer collaboration
  - Create or manage the feature/story backlog
  - Set priorities in release and iteration planning
  - Identify and define features/stories
  - Define acceptance criteria
  - Review and accept completed features and stories
  - Interact on a continuous basis with the development team
  - Accept accountability for results and adapting constraints

## No More self organizing teams

- Self organizing teams are at the core of agile management
- However, concepts have become corrupted and counterproductive in parts of the agile community
- Although a good term, it has become confused with anarchy
  - A contingent within the agile community encouraged an anarchist management style
  - They have latched onto the term because it sounds better than anarchy
- Larger and larger organizations loose what it means to be agile as they implement agile methods and practices
  - These organization reject the cultural piece of agile
  - The empowering organizational culture
