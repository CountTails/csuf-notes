# Lecture 8: agile project management (the speculate phase)

## Speculation

> To form a theory or conjecture about a subject without firm evidence

- Speculation establishes target and direction, but at the same time indicates that, we expect much to change over the life of a project
- Planning is an important activity, but speculating is a more appropriate term as uncertainty increases

### Speculating on product and project

- Two crucial components of an iterative planning and development approach
  - 1) Short iterative time boxes: teams have to figure out faster ways of accomplishing every aspect of development
  - 2) Features: the first goal is to make the process visible and understandable to the customer team
- Product teams speculate about the features in a project and try to make the engineering teams understand those features and requirements
- Product teams attach value points to the features and make priority decisions
- Engineering teams translate the feature from customer view to a technical view to design and build the product
- Product managers control *which* features are included
- Development engineers control *how* features are designed and implemented

### Product backlog

- Simply put, a product backlog expands the product vision into a product feature list
- Product backlog serves as a platform from which the product team determines the significance and priorities of each feature
- The feature list consists of creating story cards that contain basic descriptive and estimating information
- The stories should identify
  - People involved who will used the feature
  - Functions performed by these people
  - Breaking down of feature into implementable stories

### Feature stories

- A feature or story is defined as a piece of product that delivers some useful and valuable functionality to a customer
- Stories are basically small portions of an entire epic feature
- Stories deliver useful functionality, but may not deliver a complete function

## Decomposition of features

**A large and complex story**

- As a frequent flyer I want to book flights customized to my preferences, so I save time

**Decomposed into multiple stories**

1) As a frequent flyer I want to book a trip using miles so that I can save money
2) As a frequent flyer I want to easily book a trip I take often so that I can save time
3) As a premium frequent flyer I want to request an upgrade so I can be more comfortable

### Increase granularity of features

- User stories are derived from XP and are now widely used for all agile processes
- Cards provide a template to write stories and add notes
- Conversations require face-to-face communication to help with specification
- Confirmation takes the form of acceptance tests

### User story

**Definition**

> A UserStory is a story, told by the user, specifying how the system is supposed to work, written on a card, and of a complexity permitting estimation of how long it will take to implement. The User Story promises a s much subsequent conversation as necessary to fill in the details of what is wanted. The cards themselves are used as tokens in the planning process after assessment of business value and \[possibly\] risk. The customer prioritizes the stories and schedules them for implementation.

**Templates**

```plaintext
- As a <role> I would like to be able to <action> to achieve <business value>.
- As a <user role> I can <story> so that <benefit>.
- As a <person name> can <story> so that <benefit>.
- As a <user> I want to <goal> so that <value to attain>.
```

> The "so that" line is generally considered optional, but used as a default

### Story cards

- Purpose of story cards is to provide a simple medium for
  - Gathering information about stories
  - Recording high-level requirements
  - Developing work estimates
  - Defining acceptance tests
- It is an agreement between the customer and team members to discuss detail requirements during an iteration
