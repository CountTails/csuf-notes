# Lecture 10: process improvement (from stable to capable)

## Process improvement in a high mature organization

1) Remove assignable cause
2) Change the process
3) Continually improve

### Questions to ask after encountering a problem

- Why?
- What can we do about it?
- How much is it worth?

> Taking action to improve the process will require process knowledge, information, and data beyond the process performance measurements used

### Need for additional data

- To support or validate a hypothesis about possible causes of instability
  - Data may be required to find, confirm, and eliminate root causes of instabilities and inadequate performance
- To identify, verify, or quantify cause-and-effect relationships
- To estimate the business value of the actions that are proposed to improve the process

### Compliance issues and potential sources of non-compliance

- Adherence to the process
  - Awareness and understanding of the process
  - Existence of explicit standards
  - Adequate and effective training
  - Appropriate and adequate tools
  - Conflicting or excessively aggressive goals or schedules
- Fitness and use of people, tools, technology, and procedure
  - Availability of qualified people, tools, and technology
  - Experience, education, training, and assimilation
- Fitness and use of support systems
  - Availability
  - Capacity
  - Responsiveness and reliability
- Organizational factors
  - Lack of management support
  - Personnel turnover, organizational changes or relocation
  - Downsizing, disruptive personnel or morale problems

### Summary of generic assignable cause

- Erroneous data
  - Data collection mishaps
  - Poor or loose operational definitions of measures causing misinterpretation and misunderstanding leading to incorrect data recording
- Data organization and analysis issues
  - Lack of rational sampling
  - Irrational subgroupings
  - Non-homogeneity in subgroups
  - Parallel streams, use of average from out-of-control process
- Process non-compliance
  - People, skill mix, resources, support, and management
  - Careless or inconsistent process execution
  - Work environment changes
- Flawed or inadequate process design
- Change in characteristics of one or more process elements or causes

## What is a capable process?

- The process must be brought into a state of statistical control for a period of time sufficient to detect any unusual behavior
- The capability of the process must meet or exceed the specifications that have to be satisfied to meed business or customer requirements
