# Lecture 4: data collection

## Collecting data

**Tasks**

- Designing the methods and obtaining the tools
- Training the staff
- Capturing and recording data
- Using predefined forms and formats to supply the collected data to the individuals and groups who perform analysis
- Monitoring the data collection activities

**Activities**

- Identifying the relevant individuals and groups
- Clearly specifying when, when, how measurements will be made
- Clearly defining the procedures for recording and reporting results
- Providing standard "fill-in-the-blank" forms to simplify manual recording of data

## Issues in measuring the stability and capability of a process

### Time sequence

- The order of the observations made contain crucial information
- Helps to identify where special (assignable) causes of variation entered the process
- Help to identify the causes of problems

### Context data

- What do the individual values represent? What are these numbers?
- How were values obtained? Who obtained them? When or how often?
- What sources of variation are present in the data?

### Rounding of data values

- Discussed in Ch. 6

### Measurement stability

- Testing and evaluating new or changed data collection processes with pilot runs

## Criteria of credible collected data

### Verity

- Ensure the collected data have the following characteristics
  - Are of the correct type
  - Are in the correct format
  - Are within specified range
  - Are complete
  - Are arithmetically correct

### Synchronicity

- Measurements are synchronous when the values for two or more attributes are related with respect to the time of their occurrence
- The goal is to ensure valid cause-and-effect relationship

### Consistency

- The "apples-to-apples" issue

### Validity

- Control charts, covered in ch.4, are helpful when discussing validity

## Retaining data

- Who will enter and maintain the data
- Who can access data as well as the level of access
- Where will the data be retained
- Tools used
