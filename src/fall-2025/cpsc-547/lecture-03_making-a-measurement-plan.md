# Lecture 3: making a measurement plan

## Integrate measures with the software process

- Use a good checklist
  - State exactly what is included and what is excluded
  - Should be consistent with what are covered in the tracking process
  - May use other frameworks

### Analysis of existing measurement activities

- Check data sources in your organization's problem tracking (most have some sort of tracking process)
- Find answers to the following:
  - What data elements are required for my measures?
  - Which ones are collected now?
  - How are they collected?
  - Which process provides the data?
  - How are the elements stored and reported?

### Diagnosis of existing measures

- Analysis is fact finding and diagnosis evaluative and judgmental
- Diagnosis leads to identifying alternatives as well as solutions
- Typical questions to ask:
  - What existing measures and processes can be used to satisfy the data requirement?
  - What elements of the measurement definitions or practices must be changed or modified?
  - What new or additional processes are needed?

### Actions taken before developing the measurement plan

- Identify sources of data from organization's processes
- Define data collection and reporting method
- Identify tools to be used
- Define requirements for timings and frequencies of measurement
- Document collection procedures
- Determine who will use the data
- Define how the data will be analyzed and reported
- Prepare a data definition and collection process guide

## Develop the measurement plan

1) Prepare the plan
2) Track the status of action-planning activities

### Practical measurement

> Unless there is a manager or other decision maker with an information need, measurement serves no purpose

**Measurement helps managers to**

- Communicate effectively
- Track specific project objectives
- Identify and correct problems early
- Make key trade-off decisions
- Justify decisions

### Common software information categories

- *Schedule and progress*: achievement of milestones and completion of work units
- *Resources and cost*: balance between work to be performed and personnel resources assigned
- *Product size and stability*: stability of functionality
- *Product quality*: ability of product to support user's need without failure
- *Process performance*: capability of the supplier relative to the project needs
- *Technical effectiveness*: viability of proposed technical approach

### Lessons learned from successful measurement programs

- Start small
- Provide adequate training
- Demonstrate commitment
- Minimize costs
- Adopt an action orientation
- Communicate
