## Profession

### Components of a profession

- Profession: a vocation that requires a high level of eduction and practical experience in the field
  - Doctors
  - Lawyers
  - CPAs
- Eight components of mature profession
  - Initial profession eduction
  - Accreditation
  - Skills development
  - Certification
  - Licensing
  - Professional society
  - Code of ethics
  - Professional development

  - Skills development: work under supervision for 2 years
  - Licensing: CPA exam
  - Professional development: code of ethics + continuing education

### Is software engineering a profession?

- Certification and licensing not needed
  - Many self-taught programmers
  - Most software engineers work as part of a team
- A code of ethics was created by ACM and IEEE-CS in 1993
  - ACM opposed licensing, arguing field immaturity and ineffectiveness at addressing software quality and reliability
  - Agreed software engineers have the ability to harm the public
  - Reproduced in 2011 by ACM

## Software engineering code of ethics

- A practical framework for moral decision-making for problems software engineers may encounter
- Preamble describes
  - Why the code was developed
  - Intention of the code
  - How the code should be interpreted and used for making moral decisions by software engineers
- Principles identify key ethical relationships and obligations in
  - The eight principles
  - Concerns for the public interest is paramount
- Clauses in each principle to illustrate the obligations

### Eight principles

1) Public: act consistently with public interest
2) Client and employer: act in best interest of client and employer
3) Product: ensure products meet highest standards
4) Judgement: maintain integrity in professional judgement
5) Management: promote effective project management
6) Profession: advocate the profession
7) Colleagues: be fair and supportive of colleagues
8) Self: participate in life long learning

### Ground ethical theories for the code

- Major ethical questions reflected in the code
  - Who is affected? Utilitarianism
  - Am I treating other human beings with respect? Kantianism
  - Would my decision hold up to public scrutiny? Virtue ethics
  - How will those who are *least* empowered be affected? Rawls' second principle of justice
  - Are my acts worthy of the ideal profession? Virtue ethics

### Ground virtue ethics in the code

- Virtues reflected in fundamental principles
  - Be impartial
  - Disclose information that others ought to know
  - Respect the rights of others
  - Treat others justly
  - Take responsibility for your actions and inactions
  - Take responsibility for the actions of those you supervise
  - Maintain your integrity
  - Continually improve your abilities
  - Share you knowledge, expertise, and values

### Moral decision-making by the code

- A three step process
  - 1) Identify those fundamental principles that are relevant to the moral problems
  - 2) Search the list of clauses accompanying each of the relevant fundamental principles to see which speak most directly to the issue
  - 3) Determine whether the contemplated actions aligns with or contradicts the statements in the clauses
    - If the action is in agreement with all of the clauses, that provides strong evidence the action is moral
    - If the action is in disagreement with all of the clauses, it is safe to say the action is immoral
    - If two clauses are in conflict with the given moral problem, use our judgement to determine which of the clauses are more important before we can reach a conclusion about the morality of the contemplated problem
- The code should be seen as a whole
  - Not a simple ethical algorithm that generates ethical decisions
  - Provides an ethical foundation to which individuals within teams and the team as a whole can appeal

## Morality of whistleblowing

- Whistleblower
  - Tries to report harmful situation through authorized channels
  - Makes disclosure through unauthorized channels
- Motives of whistleblowers
  - Good motive: desire to help the public
  - Questionable motives: retaliation
- Possible negative consequences (for the whistleblower)
  - Rebuffed by organization and punished for their actions
  - Lose job or chance of advancement
  - Financial and emotional hardships
- Government legislation
  - False claims act
  - Whistleblower protection act

### Whistleblowing cases

- Challenger explosion: an engineer left the company
- Hughes aircraft: Ruth Goodearl, harassed, fired, bankruptcy, divorced
- Volkswagen emissions and Wells Fargo bank accounts (no whistleblowing here)
- Corporate views of whistleblowing
  - Whistleblowers are disloyal and has many harms such as bad publicity, disruption of organization's social fabric, make it hard for people to work as a team
  - Can be a big sign of organization failure

### Whistleblowing as a duty

- Checklist
  - 1) Is serious harm to the public at stake?
  - 2) Have you told your manager?
  - 3) Have you tried every possible inside channel?
  - 4) Do you have persuasive documented evidence
  - 5) Are you sure the whistleblowing will work?
- Under what conditions must you blow the whistle?
  - If 1-3 are met, you have the *right* to whistleblowing
  - If all 5 conditions are met, you have the *duty* to whistleblowing 
- Others still argue: whistleblowing is *never* morally required
