# Lecture 4: work and wealth

## Automation and unemployment

### Job destruction

- Some argue automation destroys jobs
  - 40% of manufacturing jobs lost between 1979-2011
  - Many companies filing for bankruptcy
  - U.S. population increases by 39%
- Lost white-collar jobs
  - Secretarial and clerical positions
  - Accountants and bookkeepers
  - Middle managers

### Job creation

- Some argue automation created more or new jobs
- Effects of increased productivity due to automation
  - Number of manufacturing jobs worldwide has increased
  - Workers today work less than workers 100 years ago
- Contrast to medieval or ancient times
  - Low caloric intake meant pace of work was slow
  - Work was seasonal or intermittent
  - Laborers resisted working if they had enough money (when wages rose, laborers worked less because they weren't consumers)

### Rise of robots

- Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and technologies
  - Robots replace many tasks
  - Autonomous vehicles
  - Replacing labor and knowledge intensive jobs
- What will happen as computers continue to increase in speed
  - What if quantum computers become real?
  - Will most jobs be taken over by machines?
- Many moral questions related to robotics
  - Is it morally acceptable to create a personal AI?
  - Are we prepared to grant a personal AI the same rights guaranteed to human persons?
  - Do we have to make sure the AI be benevolent towards humans?

## Workplace changes

**Organization changes**

- Automating back-office functions: improving manufacturing communication among business units
- Flattened organizational structures: eliminating transactional middlemen

**Telework**

- Home office, commuting to a telecenter
- Advantages of telework
  - Increases productivity
  - Reduces absenteeism
  - Improves morale
  - Helps recruitment and retention of top employees
  - Saves overhead
  - Improves company resilience
  - Helps environment
  - Saves employees money
- Disadvantages of telework
  - Threatens managers' control and authority
  - Makes face-to-face meetings impossible
  - Sensitive information is less secure
  - Team meetings are more difficult
  - Teleworkers are less visible
  - Teleworkers are "out of the loop"
  - Isolation of teleworkers
  - Teleworkers work longer hours for same pay

**Increased temporary work**

- Saves money on benefits and makes it easier to downsize
- Gig economy
- Employee monitoring
- Multinational teams

## Globalization

- The process of creating a worldwide network of business and markets
- Made possible by rapidly decreasing cost of IT
- Causes greater mobility of goods, services, and capital around the world

| For globalization | Against globalization |
| ----------------- | --------------------- |
| Increases competition | Makes the US subordinate to the World Trade Organization (WTO) |
| People in poorer countries deserve jobs | Forces American workers to compete with foreigners who do not get decent wages and benefits |
| A tried-and-true route for a poor country to become prosperous | Accelerates exodus of manufacturing and white-collar jobs from the U.S. |
| Global jobs reduce unrest and increase stability | Hurts workers in foreign countries |

**Foreign workers and competition**

- H-1B
  - Right to work in the U.S. up to 6 years, but company must show no qualified Americans available
  - Congress still authorizes 65,000 H-1B visas per year, plus 20,000 more for foreigners with advanced degrees
  - Quota not filled in 2009 due to economic downturn
- L-1
  - Allows a company to transfer a worker from an overseas facility to the U.S.
  - Workers do not need to be paid the prevailing wage
  - In 2006, about 50,000 foreigners in the U.S. under L-1 visa
- Foreign competition
  - IT outsourcing in India is growing rapidly
  - China is world's #1 producer of hardware and other products
  - Number of college students in other countries is increasing rapidly

## The digital divide

- Some people have access to modern information technology while others do not
- Pippa Norris argues the evidence of the digital divide
  - Global divide higher internet access in wealthy countries, good IT infrastructure, higher literacy, higher in English-speaking countries
  - Social divide access higher for younger and well-educated people
- Critiques of the digital divide
  - Suggests the difference between "haves" and "have nots"
  - Puts everyone into 2 categories (Marxism thinking) when reality is a continuum
  - Implies lack of access leads to less advantaged social position, but may be the other way around
  - Technological diffusion
    - Think about how industrial revolution has changed the world
    - Many countries become independent from British empire
    - US technologies and resources

**Related issues**

- Net neutrality: all internet packets be treated the same
- Tiered service: by internet backbone charging more
- Massive open online courses: a way to make **higher education** more affordable or free

## The "winner-take-all" society

- A few top performers have disproportionate share of wealth
- Causes
  - IT and efficient transport systems
  - Networked economics
  - Dominance of the English language
  - Changing business norms

**Harmful effects**

- Drawing some of most talented people into socially unproductive work
- Concentrating a disproportionate share of best students in few elite institutions
- Unfairly compensating those with just slightly inferior performance
- Harming our culture

**Reducing negative effects**

- Limit number of hours that stores remain open
- Businesses form cooperative agreement to reduce positional arms race
- More progressive tax structures
- Campaign finance reforms

## Wealth gaps

- The top 1% accounted for more than 30% of the nation's wealth
- The top 10% accounted for more than 67% of all wealth

**What to do about the gap**

- Modern society
  - Until 20th century, major discovery by century, advanced transportation and communication
  - The speed of discovery of new information and knowledge and sharing are accelerated
- Increasing gaps
  - Wealth gap
  - Technology gaps
  - Education and intelligence gaps
  - If middle class collapses, it can lead to serious conflict
- Addressing the gaps
  - Civilization vs. stable society (adopting some ideas of socialism)
  - Educators, politicians, and government policy makers should think about a solution or at least the direction toward a solution
