# Lecture 4: limitations and economic implications of software change

## Economic implications of software change

- Large portion of computing resources spent towards maintaining software
- Studies show the cost ranges from 60% - 75% of computing resources
  - 50% goes towards perfective maintenance
  - 25% goes towards adaptive maintenance
  - 20% goes towards corrective maintenance
  - 5% goes towards preventive maintenance
- Actual maintenance costs may differ based on applications and settings

## Limitations to software change

> All changes requested/required cannot be performed due to the following reasons

1) *Resource limitations*: lack of skilled maintainers, unsuitable tools and environment, insufficient budget
2) *Quality of existing system*: quality is so poor that change is virtually impossible and no longer viable
3) *Organizational strategy*: insufficient budget allocated based on problem analysis and would rather base it to be on par with other organizations
4) *Inertia*: resistance to change by users (adapt to changes)
5) *Skilled staff*: difficulty of attracting and retaining skilled maintenance personnel

## Potential solutions to the maintenance problem

**Budget and effort reallocation**

- Allocate less resources to unmaintainable or difficult to maintain systems
- More resources should be allocated to specification and design of a more maintainable system

**Complete system replacement**

- Develop a new system rather than maintaining a legacy system

**Maintenance of existing software**

- Other solutions are somewhat unrealistic in may cases
- Need to work on
  - How to better maintain existing systems
  - How to build better maintainable systems
- By providing more cutting edge technology, use-driven functionalities, tools and methods
