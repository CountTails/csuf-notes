# Lecture 6: the initial process

## The nature of the initial process

- Most software organizations operate in this level for some time
- Many never leave this level
- Professionals are driven from crisis to crisis by
  - Unplanned priorities
  - Unmanaged change
- Difficult to identify groups working at this level in the short term
- Easy to spot in the long term as the group fails to meet commitments
- Managers may present a facade of control, but last minute crises can reveal the truth
- Occasional successes are accidental and are often driven by individual heroics

## What is a chaotic project

- Inadequate project management may destroy years of good technical work
- Lack of plan
  - No idea of size of project
  - No basis to know where you stand
  - No justification for additional resources when needed
- Projects run seriously late
- Customer are convinced that the project is out of control

## Why software organizations are chaotic

- Determining the task size requires work
  - No idea how much code a function requires
  - No idea how much effort it takes to implement and test a function
- Lack of commitment discipline is the most common cause of chaotic behavior

**Unplanned commitments**

- Under pressure, managers may guess instead of making a plan
- Simple-looking functions can have a hidden trap
- Lack of plan generally means insufficient resources

**Gurus**

- Technical wizards can become overconfident in their abilities
  - Believe they can do no wrong
  - Small successes lead them to believe they can develop anything
- Introduce a new technology as a temporary fix

**Magic**

- Humans are adverse to complexity
- Technology may help, but effective management is the key

**Problems of scale**

- An escalating cycle
  - Programs take more code than is expected
  - Larger programs expose technical and management issues
  - New experiences mean these are surprises
- Progressive levels of scale
  - One person understands the entire program
  - Understood at the management level, but separate teams only understand their component
  - Nobody understands the program
- Knowledge is widely distributed
  - Common notations needed for communication
  - Standards must be documented and kept up to date
  - Conflicts in standards may be found and resolved
  - Changes in standards must be controlled and distributed
  - Large scale software requires similar control for requirements, design, code, and test
- Big software requires multiple releases
  - Total functionality cannot be completed on time
  - Some needs cannot be understood until partial system is used
  - Some design issues cannot be resolved until preliminary versions are runnable
  - User priorities are not set, so the release cycle assists in setting them
  - Large software cannot be built successfully in one pass anyway
- Multiple releases introduce new complications
  - Requirements must be phased to meat end user needs
  - Software component design must synchronize with these needs
  - Product interdependencies must be orchestrated to meet release functional prerequisites
  - Build and integration plans must be scheduled around interdependencies
  - Early system drivers must be schedules to meet component test needs
  - Tight schedules require subsequent release development before prior ones are completed
- More surprises will arise as a new software scale is reached
  - Affect individual contributors and management
  - Affect technical tools and methods used

## Software process entropy

- Entropy is the disorganization of the software process
  - More entropy means more chaos
  - Many forces contribute to entropy
- Even with established project management, 3 classes of forces tend to disrupt it
  1) Dynamic requirements
  2) Increasing system size
  3) Human nature

## The way out

**Out of the chaos trap**

1) Apply systematic project management
  - Estimate and plan work
  - Manage work tasks
2) Adhere to careful change management
  - Control changes
  - Across the board: requirements, design, code, and test
3) Utilize independent software assurance
  - Independent technical means to ensure project activities are conducted properly

**Controlling the chaos**

- Plan the work
- Track and maintain the plan
- Divide the work into independent parts
- Precisely define the requirements for each part
- Rigorously control the relationships among the parts
- Treat software development as a learning process
- Recognize what you don't know
- Fix knowledge gaps before proceeding with a task
- Manage, audit and review work to ensure it is done as planned
- Commit to your work and work to meet your commitments
- Refine the plan of knowledge of the job improves
