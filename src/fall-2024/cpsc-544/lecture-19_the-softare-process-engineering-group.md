# Lecture 19: the software process engineering group

- Based off the way processes are handled in other fields
- Software work differs from typical factory work, but still requires specialists
- Software process improvement require someone to be
  - Assigned the responsibility
  - Given the necessary resource

## Changing the software process

- Challenging part of changing a software process is the need to change the way software people do their work
- This make software process change both painfully slow and haphazard

**Tasks for software process improvement**

- Identify the key problems
- Establish priorities
- Define action plans
- Get professional and management agreement
- Assign people
- Provide training and guidance
- Launch implementation
- Track progress
- Fix the inevitable problems

**People for software process improvement**

- Focal point for change effort is the Software Engineering Process Group (SEPG)
- Additionally involves the following
  - Senior management
  - Line projects
  - Software quality assurance
  - Education, finance, and administration
  - Software professionals

## The role of the SEPG

- Has two basic tasks
  1) Initiation and sustaining process change
  2) Supporting normal operations
- Serves as the spawning ground for other groups
- Projects must not be disrupted with excessive change
  - Software process should be viewed as continuous learning
  - Involves learning new methods and accommodating to the changing nature and scale of problems
- Change brings current software practice up to the level of current knowledge
  - People typically know how to do their work better than they currently do it 
  - Most software problems are caused by a lack of discipline to apply the best known methods
  - Building such discipline requires a painstaking improvement program
- Change is a normal part of software management
  - The SEPG ensures changes are effectively implemented
  - Also serves as a consolidating force for changes that have already been made and should support projects using them

### The SEPG as a change agent

- Change agents provide the energy, enthusiasm, and direction to overcome resistance and cause change
- SEPG fills this role by providing
  - The skilled resources
  - The creativity
  - The management leverage needed
- Decision to make changes lies with line management, but SEPG provides technical guidance on what changes are most important
- When management approves action plans, the SEPG leads the launch effort
  - Providing leadership in getting them staffed
  - Supporting the work with needed information, training, and skills
- SEPG also tracks action plan progress and inform management of status and major problems

### The SEPG sustaining role

- Establish process standards
- Maintain the process database
- Serve as the focal point for technology insertion
- Provide key process education
- Provide project consultation
- Make periodic assessment and status reports

## Establishing standards

- SEPG is the focal point for establishing process standards
  - Includes product-relate and proces-related standards
  - SEPG staff cannot develop all standards and must work with teams members from the most involved groups
- The SEPG standards role involves the following
  - Recommend priorities for developing standards
  - Ensure that prior work on the subject is reviewed
  - Include available experts and users on the standards development team
  - Conduct final standard reviews and approvals

## The process database

- The process database is the permanent repository for data gathered on the software process and the resulting products
- Data provides the reference for improving
  - Estimation accuracy
  - Analyzing productivity
  - Assessing product quality
- It is used by 
  - Process specialists
  - Project professionals
  - The quality staff
  - Management
- The types of information retained in the process database include
  - Size, cost and schedule data
  - Product metrics
  - Process metrics
- Considerations for an effective process database
  - State the reason for gathering each piece of data
  - Specify the exact meaning of each field (with all anticipated options and exceptions)
  - Have simple and easy-to-use procedures for gathering the data
  - Have means to obtain data in a timely way
  - Have means to verify data accuracy
  - Provide resources and procedures for entering data into the database
  - Make provisions for users to access and analyze data
  - Make provisions to protect and maintain the data

## Technology insertion focal point

Technology support of any reasonably large software organization involves seven activities

1) A process definition is needed to identify tasks used
2) A set of requirements is developed for the needed support
3) These requirements must be approved by the users, the people who will handle installation and support, and management
4) A search is then made to identify commercially available tools that meet these needs
5) An overall technology plan is developed
6) A technology support group is established
7) Education, training, and consultation must be provided

## Education and training

- Education can easily consume all SEPG resources
- SEPG must be the focal point for process education, but avoid being saddled with all teaching responsibility
  - Ideally, a full-time education group does this job
  - Alternatively, knowledgeable professionals can generally serve as volunteer instructors

| Course   | Description    |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| Project management methods   | How to plan, estiamte, and track projects   |
| Software design methods   | The use of design languages, object-oriented design, and prototyping   |
| Quality management   | Methods for making quantitative quality estiamtes and plans   |
| Design and code inspections   | How to run work product reviews   |

## Process consultation

- Key focus for the process group is on improving the practice of software engineering
  - Done by working with software practitioners and providing assistance and staying current on project's problems
  - Not staying current means the group cannot relate to the practicing professionals
- SEPG can be host helpful to the project by consulting on
  - The process data they should gather
  - The analyses and interpretation of the data gathered
  - Tuning the standard process to unique project needs
  - Assisting with the preparation of quality plans
  - Serving as experience inspection moderators
  - Advising on the priority areas for technology insertion

## Process status and assessment

- SEPG is also responsible for understanding the current state of software practice and alerting management of key problems
  - Awareness of how completely each project's process is defined
  - Knowledge of how the process is implemented
  - Judgment on when an assessment would be appropriate
  - Leadership in conducting assessments
- Senior management reviews conducted as least quarterly will provide
  - An overview of the state of the software process
  - A summary of process improvement status and plans
  - Priority items for management attention
- The items required to make senior management reviews effective
  - Goals for process improvement
  - A comparison of the actual process state to prior plans
  - The status of the process improvement actions
  - Identified problems and recommended corrective actions
  - Recommended responsibilities for handling these actions

## Establishing the SEPG

### Question to address

1) How big should the effort be?
2) Where does the staff come from?
3) Who should head it?
4) Where should it report?
5) What are the tasks for initial focus?
6) What are the key risks?
7) How is its effectiveness evaluated?

### Size and staffing

- Aim for full-time assignments to the SEPG of about 2 percent of the software professionals
- For large organizations, the range falls between 1 and 3 percent, determined by
  - The ability to recruit suitable candidates
  - The financial constraints of the organization

### Leadership and reporting

- Leader must
  - Be a knowledgeable manager with a demonstrated ability to make things happen
  - Has the respect of project professionals
  - Has the support of top management
- Official agents for process change should
  - Be enthusiastic about leading the change process
  - Be both technically and politically capable of understanding problems and implementing effective solutions
  - Have the respect of the people they deal with
  - Have management's confidence and supoort

### Priorities and risks

- Initial emphasis on project planning and project management
- Limit its focus to those tasks it can handle reasonably quickly and effectively

### Evaluating the SEPG

- User an advisory group to poll users and software professionals for their opinions
- Judge the SEPG on how effectively it applies the software process maturity framework to its own work

| Maturity level   | Description    |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| Level 2   | Does the SEPG have a plan for its work, a tracking system, and means to retain and control its work product?   |
| Level 3   | Have the SEPG professionals established a basic framework for their own work, including standards, procedures, and a review program?   |
| Level 4   | Does the SEPG measure the productivity and quality of its own work?   |
| Level 5   | Do they regularly assess their own activities for imporvement opportunities and incorporate them in their working process?   |
