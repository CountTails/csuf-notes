# Lecture 13: SCAMPI

## SCAMPI

### Appraisals and benchmarking

- Organizations benchmark their progress to
  - Ascertain maturity level scores
  - Identify improvement opportunities
  - Understand the organization's position relative to a selected model or standard
- Appraisal teams can use CMMI to guide benchmarking and help
  - Identify and prioritize findings
  - Plan improvements for the organization
- Appraisal principals for CMMI product suite are similar to other process improvement models
  - Senior management sponsorship
  - Focus on the organization's business objectives
  - Confidentiality of interviewees
  - Use of documented appraisal methods
  - Use of a process reference model as a base
  - A collaborative team approach
  - A focus on actions for process improvement
- CMMI product suite provides a rigorous appraisal method called *S*tandard *C*MMI *A*ppraisal *M*ethod for *P*rocess *I*mprovement (SCAMPI)

### Appraisal considerations

- Establish the appraisal scope
  - Organization entity being appraised
  - Process areas being investigated
  - Maturity levels or capability levels to be appraised
- Select the appraisal method
- Select appraisal team members
- Select appraisal participants to be interviewed
- Establish appraisal outputs
- Establish appraisal constraints

## SCAMPI MDD

- For comparison against other organization, appraisals must ensure consistent ratings
- Rules for this consistency are provided in the SCAMPI *M*ethod *D*efinition *D*ocument
- This document describes requirements, activities, and practices associated with the SCAMPI appraisal process
- SCAMPI appraisal have A, B, and C appraisal methods
  - A is the most rigorous and the only one that can produce a rating
  - B provides options in model scope, but characterization is fixed to one scale
  - C provides a wide range of options, including characterization of planned approaches to process implementation on a user-defined scale

| Characteristics | Class A | Class B | Class C |
| --------------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Amount of objective evidence | High | Medium | Low |
| Ratings generated | Yes | No | No |
| Resource needs | High | Medium | Low |
| Team size | Large | Medium | Small |

### MDD process

**Verify objective evidence**

- Follow rules for characterizing instantiation-level implementations of practices
  - Consensus of at least a subset of appraisal team members needed instantiation-level characterizations
- Aggregate instantiation-level characterization to derive organizational unit-level characterizations
  - Consensus of *all* appraisal team members required

**Data collection, rating, and reporting**

1) Practice implementation characterizations (practice instantiation-level)
2) Practice implementation characterization (organization unit level)
3) Goal satisfaction rating
4) Capability levels and/or maturity level ratings

**Derive findings and rate goals**

- Derive final findings
  - Preliminary findings statement
  - Feedback from validation activities
  - Additional objective evidence
- Rate each specific goal and each generic goal
- Obtain appraisal team consensus on the findings statement
- Findings aim to create goal-level statements that summarize gaps in practice implementation
  - Abstracted from the organization unit
  - Not focused on individual projects
- Goals are not rated if
  - Any associated practices are not characterized
  - Practices are characterized as "Not yet"
  - Associated set of objective evidence does not meet defined criteria for sufficient data coverage
- Goals are rated satisfied when
  - All associated practices are characterized as "largely implemented" or "fully implemented"
  - Aggregation of weakness associated with the goal does not have a significant negative impact on goal achievement
- To rate a goal unsatisfied, team must describe how documented rating led to the rating

### Finding and rating

**Determine process area ratings**

- If using continuous representation, assign a capability level to each process area
- If using a staged representation, rate the satisfaction of each process area
  - Assigned a value of "satisfied", "unsatisfied", "not applicable", "out of scope" or "not rated"
  - Rating of "satisfied" means all specific and generic goals are satisfied
  - If even one goal is unsatisfied, the process area is unsatisfied

**Determine process area profile**

- Graphically depicts the ratings assigned to each process area
- Considered an optional activity

**Determine maturity level**

- Based on the highest level that all process areas within that level (and below) are satisfied or not applicable
- Appraisal reference model can use equivalent staging to derive a maturity level from a capability level

### Document appraisal results

- Document all findings
- Document all rating outcomes
- Document the appraisal disclosure statement
