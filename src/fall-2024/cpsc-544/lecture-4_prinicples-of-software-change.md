# Principles of software process change

## Process in perspective

- Process management can provide
  - A basis for **assessing** software problems
  - A consistent framework for **organizational improvement**
- Process management is not a cure-all and requires 2 keys areas: **people** and **design**

### The people

- **Better** people clearly do **better** work
- Focusing purely on talent can lead to a blind alley
  - Best people are always in short supply
  - Your team is probably already the best you can get
  - Proper *leadership and support* can help most people do better work
- Make better use of the *talent you have* > recruiting better talent

### The design

- Superior products come from superior design
- Successful products are designed by people who **understand** the application
- A program can be viewed as **executable knowledge**
- Program designers should have **application knowledge**
- Along with good design, an **orderly process** can be a great help

## The 6 basic principles of software process change

### 1) Major change must start at the top

Senior management is required to:

1) Launch the change effort
2) Provide continuing resources and priority

### 2) Ultimately, everyone is involved

- Software engineering is a *team sport*
- Anyone who does not participate in improvement
  - Will miss the benefits
  - May inhibit progress

### 3) Effective change is built on knowledge

- Effect change program requires a **reasonable understanding** of the current status
- An **assessment** is an effective method to gain this understanding
  - Assessments are learning experiences
  - Provide a clear definition of key problems
  - Gain insight of professional's views on how to resolve problems
- Without this knowledge, priorities are difficult to set (priorities are the most important part of an improvement program)

### 4) Change is continuous

- Change is not a one-time event; it involves **continual learning and growth**
- Management has a hard time recognizing that *human intensive processes* are **never static**
  - Reactive changes generally make things worse
  - Every defect is an improvement opportunity
  - Crisis prevention > crisis recovery

### 5) Changes won't stick by themselves

- Precise and accurate work is rarely sustained without **continual reinforcement**
- New methods should be *carefully* introduced and *periodically* monitored (or they decay)
- Adoption of new process methods involves 4 steps:
  1) **Installation**: involves introduction of the new method with training in their proper use
  2) **Practice**: people learn to perform the method as instructed
  3) **Proficiency**: with a learning curve, people gradually become more proficient
  4) **Naturalness**: the method becomes ingrained into people that it is performed without intellectual effort

### 6) Changes require investment

> It takes planning, dedicated people, management time, and capital investment

**Someone must work on it**

- Unquestionable that a **manufacturing process** needs to be designed before production begins
- Software processes require the same attention

**Unplanned change is wishful thinking**

- Improvement requires *detailed improvement plans* and the *resourced and dedication* to follow them
- Plans define
  - The resources needed to make the change
  - A framework for management tracking
- If process improvement is not *rigorously* planned, **it will not happen**

**Automating a bad process leads to bad results**

- Should certainly be used to resolve high-priority problems
- Is a wasteful effort until a *clear definition of the process application* is available

**Improvement should be made in small, tested steps**

- Processes can easily escape people's capabilities
- Ill-defined processed that approach people's capabilities are **unstable and erratic**
- Change processes in small steps and ensure they are tested and adjusted before wide adoption

**Training**

- Many software professionals are not adequately prepared to
  - Use the languages and tools they are given
  - Understand protocols and system services they need
  - Effectively use the organization's process
  - Appreciate the subtleties of the application they are Implementing
  - Plan and track their own work
- Without training, necessary learning is gained through *trial and error*
  - Wastes time and money
  - Often involves a *lot* of error
- Training is expensive, but is less than the cost of **not** training
  - Requires a training plan
  - Hiring or retaining of some specialists
  - Must define or retain the **required courses**

## Common misconceptions of software process change

### We must start with firm requirements

- **Widespread fallacious view**: 
  - Requirements are the customer's job
  - Development should not start until they are explicitly defined
- **Reality**:
  - Requirements **must change** as the job progresses
  - Practical to use an *incremental development process* that gradually increases the level of detail
  - Requirements and the implementation are **mutually refined**
- Stable requirements
  - Solution gradually evolves into something more likely to meet user needs
  - Requirement problem can appear at any time
  - **Must** be resolved at the requirements level; not just a patch in design or implementation
- Premature requirements freezes
  - Argument against the incremental approach is that it takes **too long**
  - True when initial requirements are firm, accurate, and precise
  - It is **not the general case** and is only occasionally feasible

### If the tests pass, it must be OK

- **Fallacious view**: the statement is not a fallacy, but the converse *is*
- **Reality**:
  - Larger and more complex programs execute in environments are are complex and unpredictable
  - Testing progressively gets *less reliable* as an indicator of software quality

### Software quality cannot be measured

- There is *no* measure the can comprehensively measure software quality
- Quality measures are valuable, so they should be found and used
- Discussions requires use of numbers, which requires measurement
- Without measurement, a quality program produces little useful action

### The problems are technical

- Problems are cost, schedule and quality remain
- The highest priority problems are *not technical*
  - Controlling high volumes of change
  - Recovering from late-discovered defects
  - Reacting to unanticipated crises

### We need better people

- Software professionals are erroneously blamed
- True cause is not the people, but the **process**
- Getting the best talent will not solve the problem
- Most problems can only be fixed through management action

### Software management is different

- Traditional management methods can and should be used
- Software engineering is *different* from other engineering disciplines
- Many unique characteristics apply to software, but they all require more management discipline

## Implementing software process change

### The strategy

- Software people are *not* averse to change, but mishandled changes will generate resistance
- Change process has 3 stages:
  1) **Unfreezing**: involves an effort to understand the problem and make aware the opportunities for improvement
  2) **Moving**: change planning an implementation
  3) **Refreezing**: ensure an achieved capability is retained in general practice

### Champions, sponsors, and agents

- **Champions** are the ones who initiate the change process
  - Bring management's attention to the problem
  - Obtain blessing of sponsor
  - Establish credibility to get change program launched
- **Sponsors** someone in authority who recognizes the value of the work (typically a senior manager)
  - Provide resources
  - Officially back the change program
- **Agents** will lead change planning and implementation

### The elements of change

**Planning**

- Involve a knowledgeable representative from each affected group
- Ensure a competent plan is developed and makes acceptance more likely
- Caution should be taken when starting implementation

**Implementation**

- Maintain a continuous stream of action and successes
- Helps reassure people of change benefits
- Helps to ensure continued executive support

**Communication**

- Public plans
- Periodic progress reports
- Early demonstration of successes
