# Software process assessment

## Assessment overview

- Process assessment help organizations improve by
  - Identifying their critical problems
  - Establish improvement priorities
- Process assessment objectives are
  - Learn how the organization works
  - Identify its major problems
  - Enroll its opinion leaders in the change process
- Process assessment is **not an audit**, but a *review* of the organization
- Conducted by a team of software professionals with assessment experience or training

## Assessment phases

### Preparation

- Senior management commits to the process
- Plans to take action on assessment results or justify why not
- Concludes with a brief 1-2 day training program for the assessment team

### Assessment

- The on-site assessment period, taking 1-2 weeks depending on organization size
- Concludes with a preliminary report of findings

### Recommendations

- Findings and recommended actions are presented to local managers
- Local action team is formed to plan and implement recommendations
- Assessing organization may provide assistance and may participate in a follow-up assessment

## 5 assessment principles

### 1) Start with a process model

- An assessment implies a standard
- Organization process is reviewed and compared with some vision of how such process should be performed

### 2) Observe strict confidentiality

- Purpose is to support the organization's improvement program, not to report problems to higher management
- Can be difficult to maintain confidentiality, particularly when executives demand to know the results
- If confidentiality is not maintained, people will learn they cannot speak in confidence
- Wide spread confidentiality breaches can make it difficult to conduct assessments that are useful

### 3) Involve senior management

- Senior management sets organization priorities
- Must be personally involved with assessment and its follow-up action plans
- Lack of involvement may lead to change work having low priority

### 4) Keep an open mind and level head

- Even when assessment is appropriately supportive, some people can feel resentful and may not cooperate
- If team member action's demonstrate a desire for active collaboration, people generally respond positively

### 5) Focus on action

- Assessment must be directed toward improvement
- Action orientation keeps questions focused on current problems and the need to solve them
- Assessment that generally explore problems cannot produce useful recommendations for improvement
- Management must either focus on taking action or not conduct the assessment

## Assessment process

1) Identify the organization being assessed and the team to do it
2) Acquire manager's commitment to do the assessment and assign sufficient resources to get it done

### Forming the assessment team

- Team leader is selected first
- Team members should be experienced software developers
- One or more should have experience is each phase of the software process
- 4-6 members is typically adequate, but more can be used if desired

**Selecting team members**

- Each assessment team member should
  - Have 8-10 years of professional software experience
  - Be well respected in the organization
  - Be able to deal with people in an informal, non-threatening manner
  - Be a team player
  - Have attended assessment training with *this* team
- **No** assessment team member should
  - Be currently serving in an audit or review capacity for any projects being assessed
  - Be a line manager over any project being assessed or people being interviewed
  - Be working directly on any project being assessed

### The on-site period

- Assessment starts with a briefing to site manager and staff
- Discusses ground rules, assessment principles, and overall schedule
- Overview meeting held with site participants (managers and professionals being interviewed)

| Day | Activity |
| --- | -------- |
| 1 | Assessment overview, briefing, questionnaires, project discussions |
| 2 | Functional area interviews, preliminary findings |
| 3 | Project discussions, finding formulation |
| 4 | Findings dry run, review and presentation, senior management meeting, assessment post-mortem |

## Assessment conduct

- Assessment should focus on
  - What projects actually do
  - How projects do it
  - Problems encountered
  - Results obtained
- Set of questions should be prepared in advance of actual assessment period
- Meetings are held with selected professionals with expertise in various facets of the software process

### Selecting functional area representatives

- Identify 6-8 representatives
- Meetings should last 90-120 minutes
- Potential areas of specialty include
  - Quality assurance and release
  - Software integration and test
  - Coding and unit tests
  - Requirements and design
- Each representative should be
  - A recognized opinion leader in the selected area
  - Working on projects rather than on staff
  - A technical professional, not a manager
  - Aware of the assessment process and confidentiality agreements

### Probing questions

- Can be difficult to obtain *accurate* information
- Questions can be misunderstood
- Respondents could have different understandings of common terms
- Respondents may not be broadly aware of the work in their own organization
- Occasionally, people are unwilling to be truthful

### Conclusions

- Assessment team prepares a preliminary report of findings
- Report should be a composite summary of site status
- Before reviewing with site manager, assessment team should review it with project managers
- Ensure any overlooked problems are identified or any misstated or overemphasized problems are corrected
- Last site action is to review composite findings with site manager and staff
  - Address any questions and schedule follow-up work
  - If possible, site personnel should attend this meeting

### Finding formulation

- Findings should be limited to the top 10-12 items that are:
  - Major issues for most projects reviewed
  - Key issues for most projects previewed
  - Key issues for advancing to the next maturity level
  - Supported by evidence from the assessment
  - Addressable by an action recommendation
  - Specific (avoid sweeping generalizations)
- Presentation overview
  - Agenda
  - Scope: projects assessed
  - Assessment conducted (schedule)
  - Summary composite status (the bad news)
  - Strengths noted (the good news)
  - Findings summary
  - Details of findings (each one)
  - Next steps
- Findings format
  - What the team observed
  - Consequences (implications of the finding for the organization)
  - Examples (specific instances of the finding, without names of people or projects)

### Report

- Final assessment team action is a written final report and recommendations
- Recommendations should highlight 3-4 items with the highest priority
- Limit total number of items requiring action to 10
- Assessment team should clearly explain the rationale for implementation priority

### Action plans

- Prepared by the **local site organization** under guidance of assessment team member named for this purpose
- Member should be fully knowledgeable of issues and can start quickly

### Reassessments

- Conducted 1-2 years after initial **action plans** are developed and approved
- Allows assessment of progress made
- Provides a future milestone of completion of actions
- Establishes new priorities for continued improvement

## Implementation considerations

- Greatest risk: no significant improvement actions are taken
- Usually due to improper management focus and few superficial efforts made
- May revert to business as usual
- A catalyst is needed to maintain improvement priority
  - Long-term goals are established and sub-goals are set for intervening 2-3 month periods
  - Senior management performs a quarterly review 

### Risks

**Schedule conflicts**

- Crises can conflict with assessment plans
- Most damaging is on-site manager missing opening or closing meetings or both
  - Such conflicts happen with 1/3 of assessments
  - Prepare a substitute executive to speak in the manager's place

**Inadequate support**

- Assessment commitment is made too low of a management level
- Only very senior executives can take a long-term view and avoid becoming defensive
- Even high-level managers only oversee portions of the organization and cannot provide adequate organization-wide priority

**Lack of follow-through**

- Management changes or other high-priority issues reduce focus on action plan implementation
- Success requires the presence of
  - An aggressive manager to lead change efforts
  - A capable process improvement staff
  - A clearly stated improvement goal

### Staffing

- Generally the most serious implementation problem
- Staff required for the assessment team
- Full time staff required to guide improvement efforts
- Part-time participation in action plan working group
- Project review and implementation of resulting actions
