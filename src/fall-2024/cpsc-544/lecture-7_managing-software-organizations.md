# Lecture 7: managing software organizations

## Commitment discipline

- The foundation of software project management
- Supported by plans, estimates, reviews, and tracking systems to ensure commitments are met
- Not met by reviews, procedures, or tools; commitments are met by **people**

### Making a commitment

- Commitments involve
  - A planned completion date
  - Some consideration of payment
- Mutual commitments are needed when coordinated efforts of multiple professionals are involved
- Commitments are made by people **willingly**
- Commitments are **not** made lightly
- Commitments are agreements between parties about
  - What is to be done
  - Who is to do it 
  - When it is to be completed
- Commitments are openly and publicly stated
- Person responsible does all possible to meet a commitment, even if help is needed
- If it is clear a commitment cannot be met
  - Advance notice is given
  - A new commitment is renegotiated

### The commitment hierarchy

- Work for a commitment is not completed in a vacuum
- Professionals will do their part if
  - They feel part of the organization
  - Commitments are treated seriously
- A management team should take care of
  - Making commitments
  - Insisting on extraordinary effort to meet them

### The commitment process

- This process should reach to the top of the organization
- All commitments should be made by the organization's senior executive
- Commitments are made only after formal review and concurrence process
- An enforcement mechanism ensures reviews and concurrences are conducted properly

### Establishing a commitment process

- Can be done fairly quickly
- Have a senior executive willing to insist required planning is made before commitments are made
- People should know how to create schedules and make estimates
  - Training may be required
  - Establish estimating, review, and approval procedures

## The management system

- A management system ensures projects are completed successfully
- Organization agrees on the meaning of "success" and "complete"
- Project management consists of
  - A definition of the job
  - The plan to do the job
  - Continuing management on the progress of the job
- Principles of project management
  - Each project has a plan based on a hierarchy of *commitments*
  - A *commitment* is an agreement for 1 person to do something for another
  - A management system resolves conflicts between projects and staff
  - Oversight and review audit and track progress of projects

### Product and period plans

- Resolves inherent conflicts 
- Establish a framework for operations
- Specify tasks to be performed and assigns responsibilities and resources
- Allocation of skill resources is essential to a successful plan

### Management Oversight

- Use of reviews and a contention systems helps
  - Resolve product and period plans conflicts
  - Establish a balance between line and staff
- Line and staff organizations create an annual plan and review it with involved parties
- Issues are resolved and separate plans are consolidated into a *total organization plan*
- Total plans are incorporated into the plan for the next higher organizational level
- Similar process occurs for each project area

### The contention process

- Review systems require a parallel contention system to
  - Encourage open expression of differences
  - Discuss a rational solution
- Contention systems allow for the best decisions to be made by understanding al relevant issues

### Principles of the contention system

- Major decisions are reviewed with the involved parties in advance
  - Parties are requested to agree
  - Issues should be resolved before proceeding when possible
- At decision time
  - Dissenting parties are asked to state their views
  - If there is no disagreement, senior management determines if a knowledgeable agreement has been reached
  - Decision is deferred if if any disagreeing parties are absent or more preparation is needed

### Quarterly review

- Provide a forum for resolving conflicts and monitoring progress against period and project objectives
- Topics typically include
  - Assessment of project performance against the plan
  - Assessment of organization's performance against the goals

### Project phase reviews

- Management must also assess project progress periodically
- Accomplished with a sequence of reviews at *key points* in each project

## Establishing a project management system

- Most important management review system is that conducted by the project management team itself
- Project management should be aware of project issues to be effective
- Project managers use the management system to resolve conflicts
