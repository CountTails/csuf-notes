# Requirements from the Customer Perspective

## Who is the customer?

- Whoever benefits from the product
- Whoever requests and pays for the product
- Whoever uses the product
- Whoever receives the product's output

### Customer-developer partnership

**Excellent software comes from**

- Well-executed design
- Excellent requirements

**Excellent requirements come from**

- Collaboration between customer and developer
- Understanding what is needed for success

### Customer bill of rights

1) Expect analysts to **speak** your language
2) Expect analysts to **learn** your business/objectives *for* the product
3) Expect analysts to **translate** your information into a written/graphic specification
4) Expect analysts to **explain** all of the work products or the requirements process
5) Expect analysts to **be** respectful, collaborative, and professional
6) Expect analysts to **offer** alternatives for your requirements and the product's implementation
7) Describe "easy, enjoyable to use" product characteristics
8) Expect opportunities to **adjust** requirements to allow component reuse
9) Receive credible cost and schedule impacts for changes, with tradeoffs
10) **Receive** a system that meets your needs

### Customer bill of responsibilities

1) **Educate** developers about your business (ant its jargon)
2) **Spend** all necessary time to provide and clarify requirements iteratively
3) **Be** specific and precise
4) **Make** timely decisions about requirements
5) **Respect** the developer's cost estimates and feasibility assessments
6) **Set** priorities for requirements, features, use cases
7) **Review** documents and **evaluate** prototypes
8) **Communicate** changes *immediately*
9) **Follow** the developer's change process
10) **Respect** the analyst's engineering process

## Requirement sign-off

**Problems**

- Customer doesn't read the requirements specification that they agree to
- Developer treats specification as a "cast in stone" unchanging document

**Reality**

- Impossible to know all requirements early on
- Requirements will always change

### Establishing a baseline

- **Baseline**: a snapshot of the requirements at a point in time
- Helps with conversions of fluid, work-in-progress requirements into a stable, controlled, agreed-to specification
- **Customer**: changes may renegotiate cost, schedule, and scope
- **Developer**: the baseline defines a *promise to perform*

### Stakeholder confidence

- Customer manager is assured scope won't grow wildly
- Users are assured developers will build the right system for them
- Developer manage is assured customer will stay focused on objectives and will balance cost, schedule, and functionality
- Analysts are assured changes won't create chaos
