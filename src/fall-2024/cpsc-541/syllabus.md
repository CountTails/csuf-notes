# CPSC 541 Syllabus

## Course description

Name: Systems and Software Standards and Requirements

Units: 3

Summary: This class serves as the foundation for other process-oriented classes by outlining the benefits of Software Engineering Standards. The students will be introduced to the SESC framework and the IEEE Software Engineering Standards. The course will cover establishing of the following standards: Software Life Cycle Processes, Work Product Standards, Process Standards, Requirement Analysis and Management, and System Integration. Additionally, the framework of CMMI will be introduced, and a number of practical lessons discussed.

Prerequisites: Sufficient work experience
