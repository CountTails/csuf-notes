# Lecture 6: finding the voice of the user

## Identifying user classes

**Direct and indirect users**

- Favored user class: satisfaction is closely aligned with business objectives
- Disfavored user class: normally should *not* have access to the software
- Ignored user class: will use the product, but is not built to suit their needs (secondary user)
- Other user class: nonhuman users (another program or system component)

**Forming user classes**

1) Identify and characterize early
2) Groups users based on similar needs
3) Document characteristics, responsibilities and locations
4) Create a *persona*: a fictional example of a user from that class

**Sources for user classes**

- External entities in the context diagram
- Organization charts

## User representatives

**Purpose and necessity**

- Needed for the development life cycle
  - Provide requirements
  - Review specifications
  - Evaluate demonstrations
  - Perform or witness testing
- Representation for actual users
  - Direct contact is best
  - Intermediaries (managers, sales people, marketing) can *mistranslate* user needs

**Product champions**

- Is a member of a single user class
- Serve as the primary contact between members of a single user class and the business analyst
- Collects requirements from other members and reconciles them if there are any inconsistencies
- Should have the power to make decisions
- Needs a clear understanding and should be able to see the benefits of the product
- For commercial (resold software)
  - Can be harder to find than internal or single contract projects
  - Look at long-term customers
  - Hire from the target industry

**Product champion activities**

- Planning
  - Refine scope and limitations of the product
  - Identify external system interfaces
  - Evaluate impact on business
  - Transition over to new system
- Requirements
  - Collect from other members of user class they represent
  - Develop scenarios/user cases/user stories
  - Resolve requirement conflicts with user class members
  - Define priorities
  - Evaluate prototypes
  - Provide input regarding non-functional requirements
- Validation and verification
  - Review specifications
  - Develop acceptance criteria
  - Provide test data
  - Do beta testing
- User aids
  - Write or review manuals
  - Prepare training
  - Give demo to other members of user class
- Change management
  - Evaluate and prioritize defects and enhancements
  - Determine change impact on user and business

**Multiple product champions for users**

- Ideally, there is one champion for user class
  - Each class has different tasks, needs, experience, and knowledge
- For larger user classes
  - Consider identifying subclasses
  - Consider identifying expert and non-expert users

**Overcoming resistance to having a product champion**

| Resisting statement | Resolving statement |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| "Can't afford it" | "Can't afford failure; bad requirements cause failures" |
| "Can't spare such a valuable person" | "Can't use a non-valuable person" |
| "Managers must make decisions" | "Champion makes decisions about user requirements; managers retain business decisions" |

**Product champion traps**

- Don't allow managers to override product champion's decisions
- Don't confuse the champion's view with the user's view of the product
- Avoid champions that lack a clear picture of the product and leave decisions to the business analyst
- Avoid champions that don't belong to the user class they represent

## Agree on the decision makers of requirements

| Conflict point   | Resolver    |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| Between individual users   | Product champion decides   |
| Between user classes   | More favored user decides   |
| Between corporate customers   | Use business objectives to establish priorities   |
| Between managers and users   | Defer to product champions   |
| Between developers and users | Customer decides |
